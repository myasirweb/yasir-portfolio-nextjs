My freelance projects include developing responsive custom business websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as building dynamic WordPress websites using Elementor, Elementor Kit, WooCommerce, and other essential plugins. Additionally, I develop full-stack web applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to deliver scalable and high-performance solutions. I focus on clean design, intuitive interfaces, and performance-driven solutions aligned with business goals.",
