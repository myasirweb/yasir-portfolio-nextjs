      "Since 2023, I have been working as a freelance Front-End Developer and WordPress Specialist, delivering high-quality and SEO-optimized websites tailored for startups, small businesses, and professional organizations. My freelance projects include developing responsive custom business websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as building dynamic WordPress websites using Elementor, Elementor Kit, WooCommerce, and other essential plugins. Additionally, I develop full-stack web applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to deliver scalable and high-performance solutions. I focus on clean design, intuitive interfaces, and performance-driven solutions aligned with business goals.",
